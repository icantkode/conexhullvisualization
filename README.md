# Geometric Algorithms, visualized
What began as a mandatory project for my college course has evolved beyond its initial requirements. This work, born from academic necessity, has become a passion project that I will continue to cultivate during my free time. My aim is to transform it into a comprehensive resource covering various convex hull algorithms, providing valuable insights for future undergraduates and anyone diving into this sub-domain. This project's scope extends beyond convex hulls to encompass the implementation of both concave and convex polygons, including concave hulls. The current development efforts are concentrated on refining and expanding the following components:
### Line Intersection
* using Slopes
* using cross-product
### Convex Hull
* Brute Forcing
* Jarvis March
* Graham Scan
* Interior Elimination/Quick Elimination
<br/>
Anybody is welcome to collaborate on this project :)
